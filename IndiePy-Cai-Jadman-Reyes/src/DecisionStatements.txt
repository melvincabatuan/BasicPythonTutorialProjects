<h1> Decision Statements <h1>
<br>
<h3> If Statement </h3>
<p> An if statement runs only when a certain condition is satisfied. </p>
<br>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<example>
a = 10
b = 6
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

</example>
<br>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<example>
a is greater than b
</example>

<br>

<h3> Elif Statement </h3>
<p> This statement is used when the previous conditions are not true, therefore it will satisfy the elif statement instead. </p>
<br>

<example>

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

</example>
<br>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<example>
a and b are equal
</example>
<br>
<h3> Else Statement </h3>
<p> The else statement catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions. </p>
<br>

<example>


a = 10
b = 6
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

</example>
<br>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<example>

a is greater than b

</example>
