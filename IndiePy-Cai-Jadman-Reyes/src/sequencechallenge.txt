<h1>Challenge Exercises For Sequences</h1>

<p>1. John made a list of his favorite foods. Let this list be x. Katie also made a list of her favorite foods. Let this be y.</p>
<br>
<p>x=["mango", "strawberry", "cake", "burger", "steak", "vegetables"]</p>
<p>y=["strawberry", "chicken", "fries", "mango", "ice cream"]</p>
<p>Using set operations, write a python script that finds</p>
<p>a)what common favorite foods they have</p>
<p>b)what's mutually exclusive for each of them</p>
<hint> Hint: Use Set Operations </hint>
<br>

<p> 2. A caesar cipher is derived by shifting each character by 1 unit to the right. Refer to the figure below. Generate a dictionary that takes in a character and converts it into cipher text.</p>
<hint> Review on Dictionaries, String Operations and Loops</hint>
<p>Sample:</p>
<p>Given: The quick brown fox jumped over the window 1234567890</p>
<p>Output: </p>
<example>
Uif rvjdl cspxo gpy kvnqfe pwfs uif xjoepx 1234567890
</example>

<p> 3. Let x be an empty list. Generate a list of the first 20 fibonnacci numbers starting from [0,1] and then, put it in list x and display it. </p>
<hint> Definition of Fibonacci Sequence</hint>
<p>Sample</p>
<p>Output: </p>
<example>
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]
</example>
<br>
<p>4. Create a program that prints a list of strings forming a border when printed line by line. The border is made up of a specific given character with specific given side length. The border will be a multiline string.</p>

<hint>
All sides of the border have the same number of characters. Device a formula for the middle borders with width.
</hint>

<br>
<p>Sample 1:</p>
<p>Given: character = *,  width = 7</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<example>
["*****", "*   *", "*   *", "*   *", "*****"]
</example>

<br>
<p>Output if printed line by line:</p>
<example>
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
</example>

<br>
<p>Sample 2:</p>
<p>Given: character = +, width = 7</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<example>
["+++++++", "+     +", "+     +", "+     +", "+     +", "+     +", "+++++++"]
</example>

<br>
<p>5. Write a Python program to generate and print a list except for the first 5 elements, where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included), with list comprehension. </p>
<hint>
Leave the first 5 elements part for printing. Use slicing for it.
</hint>
<br>
<p>Output: </p>
<example>
[36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
</example>
