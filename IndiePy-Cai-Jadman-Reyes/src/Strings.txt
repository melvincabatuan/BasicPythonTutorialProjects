<h1>Strings</h1>
<p>Strings are a sequence or group of unicode characters (e.g. letters, numbers, symbols, whitespaces) representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and others. </p>

<br>
<h5>How to Declare Strings</h5>
<example>
variable_name1 = "string literal"
</example>
<br>
<p>Strings are created by enclosing string literals in single quotes or double quotes.</p>

<br>
<h5>Example: Declaring Strings</h5>
<example>
my_string = 'Hello World!'
name = "Jack"

print(my_string)
print("Name: ", name)
</example>

<br>
<h5>Output</h5>
<example>
Hello World!
Name:  Jack
</example>


<br>
<h3>Multiline Strings</h3>
<p>Multiline strings are strings that span multiple lines.</p>

<br>
<h5>How to Declare Multiline Strings</h5>
<example>
variable_name1 = """Line 1 string,
Line 2 string,
Line 3 string."""

variable_name2 = '''Line 1 string,
Line 2 string,
Line 3 string.'''
</example>

<br>
<p>Multiline strings are created by enclosing strings in triple quotes, be it three double quotes or three single quotes. Anything inside the triple quotes is part of the multiline string.</p>

<br>
<h5>Example: Declaring Multiline Strings with Three Single Quotes</h5>
<example>
my_string = '''Hello World!
Name: Percy Jackson
Age: 16
Gender: Male
'''
print(my_string)
</example>

<br>
<h5>Output</h5>
<example>
Hello World!
Name: Percy Jackson
Age: 16
Gender: Male
</example>

<h5>Using Multiline Strings as Block Comments</h5>
<p>There are two ways to declare block comments or comments that span multiple lines in Python. First is using multiple single-line comments with the hash character (#). Second is using multiline strings as comments. The latter is often used for in-line documentation within the codes and for temporarily disabling a set of codes.</p>

<br>
<h5>Example: Block Comment</h5>
<example>
"""This is the start of a block comment.

This is a sample program for demonstrating using 
multiline string as a block comment.

This ends the block comment.
"""

print("Hello")
</example>

<br>
<h5>Output</h5>
<example>
Hello
</example>
