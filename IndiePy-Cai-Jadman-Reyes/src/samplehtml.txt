<h1>Tuples</h1>
<br>
<h3>What are Tuples?</h3>
<p>Tuples are similar to lists, except that tuples are immutable sequences. Meaning, once their values are assigned, they cannot be changed. </p>

<br>
<h3>How to create tuples?</h3>
<p>Tuples can be created by placing items inside parenthesis eg. (items) .</p>

<br>
<h3>Example:</h3>

<example>
def x():
	print(x)
</example>

<example>
x=(1,2,3,4,5)
print(x)
</example>

<br>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<example>
(1,2,3,4,5)
</example>

<h3>How to Access Tuple Elements</h3>
<p>Similar to lists, tuple elements can be accessed via indexing and slicing. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<example>
x=(1,2,3,4,5)
print(x[0]) #Prints the first element
print(x[-1]]) #Prints the last element
print(x[0:2]) #Prints the first two elements
</example>

<h3>Output</h3>
<example>
1
5
(1,2)
</example>
</h3>

<br>
<h3>How to delete a Tuple?</h3>
<p>Since tuple elements are immutable, this also means that tuple elements cannot be deleted. To delete whole tuples, the del keyword could be used. </p>
