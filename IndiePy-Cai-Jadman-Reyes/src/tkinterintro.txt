<h1>Tkinter</h1>
<br>
<h3>What is tkinter?</h3>
<p>Tkinter is an inbuilt python library that lets you develop graphical user interfaces (GUIS).</p>
<br>
<h3>Why GUIS?</h3>
<p>You could make your code graphical instead of text based. These GUIS help users interact with their computers.</p>
<p>Examples of GUIS include: Windows Operating System, File Explorer, Notepad, Word</p>
<br>
<h3>Tkinter Basics</h3>

<example>
import tkinter
 
root = tkinter.Tk()

#to make widgets visible, you need to pack it
 
root.mainloop()
</example>

<p>The output</p>
<br>
<p>The above statement is essentially the skeleton of every tkinter application. No tkinter application can run without it.</p>
<p>Import tkinter to start using the library. Then call the Tk() and mainloop() method. Note that Nothing is displayed since there isn't a widget packed yet.</p>
