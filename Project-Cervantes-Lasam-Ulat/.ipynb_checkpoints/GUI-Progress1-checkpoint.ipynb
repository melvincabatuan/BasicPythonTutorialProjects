    "\tProgramming/Coding is a method in which you give the computer instructions through inputting commands in a certain programming language to perform specific operations and complete given tasks. These operations could range from the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication to solving math problems such as looking for the are of a triangle or looking for the derivative of limits. \n",
    "Different Programming Languages:\n",
    "\tListed below are a list of the most commonly used programming languages and their highlights.\n",
    "1.)\tPython\n",

    "Two types of programming: \n",
    "Procedural Programming- Procedural programming is the first programming paradigm that a new developer/programmer will learn. It includes all the fundamentals of programming. This is where the developer will learn the basics of programming. \n",
    "Functional Programming- Functional programming is the programming paradigm that tries to bind several different operations into pure mathematical functions. It is a declarative style of programming that focuses on what the developer should solve rather than how the developer should solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I.\tBeginner:\n",
    "1.\tData Types – Data types are the classification/categorization of data items. Data types represent a kind of value that determines what operations could be and could not be performed on the available data. Examples of Data types are the Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean will be discussed below. However Data types may vary to the Programming Language that is being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "i.\t C++ and Java Data Types:\n",
    "Type\tKeyword\tValue range which can be represented by the Data Type\n",
    "Character\tchar\t-128 to 127 OR 0 to 255\n",
    "Number\tInt\t-32,768 to 32,767 OR -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647\n",
    "Small Number\tShort\t-32,768 to 32,767\n",
    "Long Number\tLong\t-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647\n",
    "Decimal Number\tfloat\t1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 until 6 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.\tPython Data Types:\n",
    "\tNumeric – A numeric value is any representation of data which has numerical values. There are three types of numbers in Python: \n",
    "o\tInteger: Any Positive or Negative whole numbers (No Fractions)\n",
    "o\tFloat: Any Real Number with a floating-point representation in which a fraction is denoted by a decimal or scientific notation. \n",
    "o\tComplex Number: A number with a real and imaginary component represented as “x + yj”. In which x and y are float values and j is -1. (Imaginary numbers like the square root of – values).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tBoolean – A Data Type with two values including True and False. These are represented with “True” and “False”. Inputting “true” and “false” with lower case letter would be considered an error.\n",
    "o\tTrue\n",
    "o\tFalse\n",
    "\n",
    "\tSequence – A sequence is an ordered collection of similar or different data types. Python has several built-in sequence data types:\n",
    "o\tString: A string value is a the collection of one or more characters compiled into single, double or even triple quotes depending on the requirement of the program or the developers choice.\n",
    "o\tList: A list is an organized compilation/collection of data that don’t necessarily have to be the same type and are enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "o\tTuple: A Tuple is an organized compilation/collection of data that don’t necessarily have to be the same type, but is instead enclosed in parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tDictionary – A dictionary is an unordered compilation and collection of data in a key: value pair form. Data compiled in a dictionary is enclosed in a pair of curly brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tVariables – Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. Variables could be changed to represent data. They could be used to label data with descriptive names to make it easier for the developer to understand the program. It is easier to consider variables as containers to hold certain information to be assigned by the developer. The purpose of a variable is to label and store data in memory. It can be referenced and utilized throughout the whole program/code.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.\tDebugging Techniques\n",
    "i.\tDefinition – Debugging, also known as debug, is the routine process of locating and removing computer program bugs, errors or abnormalities, which is methodically handled by software programmers via debugging tools. Debugging checks, detects and corrects errors or bugs to allow proper program operation according to set specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.\tDebugging Techniques/Strategies\n",
    "\tIncremental and bottom-up program development\n",
    "\tOne of the most effective ways to localize errors is to develop the program incrementally, and test it often, after adding each piece of code. It is highly likely that if there is an error, it occurs in the last piece of code that you wrote. With incremental program development, the last portion of code is small; the search for bugs is therefore limited to small code fragments. An added benefit is that small code increments will likely lead to few errors, so the programmer is not overwhelmed with long lists of errors. \n",
    " \n",
    "Bottom-up development maximizes the benefits of incremental development. With bottom-up development, once a piece of code has been successfully tested, its behavior won't change when more code is incrementally added later. Existing code doesn't rely on the new parts being added, so if an error occurs, it must be in the newly added code (unless the old parts weren't tested well enough).\n",
    " \n",
    "\tInstrument program to log information. \n",
    "\tTypically, print statements are inserted. Although the printed information is effective in some cases, it can also become difficult to inspect when the volume of logged information becomes huge. In those cases, automated scripts may be needed to sift through the data and report the relevant parts in a more compact format. Visualization tools can also help understanding the printed data. For instance, to debug a program that manipulates graphs, it may be useful to use a graph visualization tool (such as ATT's graphviz) and print information in the appropriate format (.dot files for graphviz). \n",
    " \n",
    "\tInstrument program with assertions.\n",
    "\t Assertions check if the program indeed maintains the properties or invariants that your code relies on. Because the program stops as soon as it an assertion fails, it's likely that the point where the program stops is much closer to the cause, and is a good indicator of what the problem is. An example of assertion checking is the repOK() function that verifies if the representation invariant holds at function boundaries. Note that checking invariants or conditions is the basis of defensive programming. The difference is that the number of checks is usually increased during debugging for those parts of the program that are suspected to contain errors. \n",
    " \n",
    "\tUse debuggers.\n",
    "\t If a debugger is available, it can replace the manual instrumentation using print statements or assertions. Setting breakpoints in the program, stepping into and over functions, watching program expressions, and inspecting the memory contents at selected points during the execution will give all  the needed run-time information without generating large, hard-to-read log files.\n",
    " \n",
    "\tBacktracking. \n",
    "\tOne option is to start from the point where to problem occurred and go back through the code to see how that might have happened. \n",
    " \n",
    "\tBinary search. \n",
    "\tThe backtracking approach will fail if the error is far from the symptom. A better approach is to explore the code using a divide-and-conquer approach, to quickly pin down the bug. For example, starting from a large piece of code, place a check halfway through the code. If the error doesn't show up at that point, it means the bug occurs in the second half; otherwise, it is in the first half. Thus, the code that needs inspection has been reduced to half. Repeating the process a few times will quickly lead to the actual problem. \n",
    " \n",
    "\tProblem simplification. \n",
    "\tA similar approach is to gradually eliminate portions of the code that are not relevant to the bug. For instance, if a function fun f() = (g();h();k()) yields an error, try eliminating the calls to g, h, and k successively (by commenting them out), to determine which is the erroneous one. Then simplify the code in the body of buggy function, and so on. Continuing this process, the code gets simpler and simpler. The bug will eventually become evident. A similar technique can be applied to simplify data rather than code. If the size of the input data is too large, repeatedly cut parts of it and check if the bug is still present. When the data set is small enough, the cause may be easier to understand.\n",
    " \n",
    "\tA scientific method: form hypotheses. \n",
    "\tA related approach is as follows: inspect the test case results; form a hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data; and then design and run a simple test to refute the hypothesis. If the hypothesis has been refuted, derive another hypothesis and continue the process. In some sense, this is also a simplification process: it reduces the number of possible hypotheses at each step. But unlike the above simplification techniques, which are mostly mechanical, this process is driven by active thinking about an explanation. A good approach is to try to come with the simplest hypotheses and the simplest corresponding test cases. \n",
    " \n",
    "Consider, for example, a function palindrome(s:string):bool, and suppose that palindrome(\"able was I ere I saw elba\") returns an incorrect value of false. Here are several possible hypotheses for this failure. Maybe palindrome fails for inputs with spaces (test \" \"); maybe it fails for programs with upper case letters (try \"I\"); maybe it fails for inputs of odd length greater than one (try \"ere\"), and so on.  Forming and testing these hypotheses one after another can lead the programmer to the source of the problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "\tBug clustering. \n",
    "\tIf a large number of errors are being reported, it is useful to group them into classes of related bugs (or similar bugs), and examine only one bug from each class. The intuition is that bugs from each class have the same cause (or a similar cause). Therefore, fixing a bug with automatically fix all the other bugs from the same class (or will make it obvious how to fix them).\n",
    " \n",
    "\tError-detection tools. \n",
    "\tSuch tools can help programmers quickly identify violations of certain classes of errors. For instance, tools that check safety properties can verify that file accesses in a program obey the open-read/write-close file sequence; that the code correctly manipulates locks; or that the program always accesses valid memory. Such tools are either dynamic (they instrument the program to find errors at run-time), or use static analysis (look for errors at compile-time). For instance, Purify is a popular dynamic tool that instruments programs to identify memory errors, such as invalid accesses or memory leaks. Examples of static tools include ESC Java and Spec#, which use theorem proving approaches to check more general user specifications (pre and post-conditions, or invariants); or tools from a recent company Coverity that use dataflow analysis to detect violations of safety properties. Such tools can dramatically increase productivity, but checking  is restricted to a particular domain or class of properties. There is also an associated learning curve, although that is usually low. Currently, there are relatively few such tools and this is more an (active) area of research.\n",
